# CS-300-Analysis-and-Design
1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course, the main problem I was trying to solve was figuring out how to work with and organize data. Such as where I had to manage large amounts of data and make sure my solutions could handle it efficiently. It was all about using the right tools to solve problems like sorting or searching through data quickly.

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To solve these problems, I started by breaking them down into smaller steps. I looked at the requirements of the project and thought about what kind of data structure would work best. For example, I used arrays or linked lists for storing simple data, and things like trees and hash maps for faster searching. Understanding how each data structure works really helped because it made me choose the best one for the job, saving me time and making my code run faster.

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
There were a few times I got stuck, especially when I was trying to make my code more efficient. I sometimes am not sure how to implement new techiniques without making the code too complicated. To get past this, I broke the problem into smaller parts and made sure I understood each step before moving forward. I also looked up some tutorials online to help me get unstuck.

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project helped me get better at thinking through problems before jumping into coding. I learned how important it is to pick the right tools for the job. I also realized that writing code isn’t just about making it work—it’s about making it work well and in a way that’s easy to understand and change later. I’m now more thoughtful about how I design my programs.

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on this project taught me to focus more on writing clean and simple code. I made sure my code was easy to read by giving variables good names and breaking it up into smaller, reusable functions. I also made sure to add comments where it made sense so that anyone (including myself) could come back and understand what I did. Now, I try to write code that can be easily updated or changed without breaking everything.
